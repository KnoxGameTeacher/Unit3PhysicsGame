Unit 3 Physics Game

This project goes over the Unity 2D Physics engine and is a reference project to be used alongside video lessons for my students at Knox Co. R-1 HS (found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM-hYnX6Ldw&list=PLoh4U8dj1iJlPFxpVta-qti_hMAVNfs9p) .  This game replicates the functionality of a block breaker game with a paddle and pong ball and progresses through pre-designed levels.

## Subjects Covered:
- 2D Sprite creation
- Prefabs and editing them
